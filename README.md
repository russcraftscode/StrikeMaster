# StrikeMaster

**StrikeMaster** is a Java-based application designed to streamline dice rolls, calculations, and unit card management for the tactical tabletop game *Alpha Strike*. With StrikeMaster, players can focus more on strategy and gameplay while the program handles the math and stat tracking.

### What it is:
A companion for games of Alpha Strike. 

### What it isn't:
- A replacement for Rulebooks or any other Catalyst Game Labs products.
- A Computer version of Alpha Strike similar to MegaMek.
   
You will still need to have all of your game materials and know how to play. This software will just help you play faster.
