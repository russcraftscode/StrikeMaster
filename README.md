# StrikeMaster

**StrikeMaster** is a Java-based application designed to streamline dice rolls, calculations, and unit card management for the tactical tabletop game *Alpha Strike*. With StrikeMaster, players can focus more on strategy and gameplay while the program handles the math and stat tracking.

### What it is:
A companion for games of Alpha Strike. 

### What it isn't:
- A replacement for Rulebooks or any other Catalyst Game Labs products.
- A Computer version of Alpha Strike.  
You will still need to have all of your game materials and know how to play. This software will just help you play faster.
